# Aterges Workflow Cleanup - README
# 
# This directory now contains only ONE active workflow:
# - deploy-backend.yml (ACTIVE - cleaned up version with testing)
#
# Disabled files (for reference):
# - deploy-backend.yml.old (original workflow)
# - deploy-backend-fixed.yml.old (first fix attempt)
#
# This prevents multiple simultaneous deployments and confusion.
# Only the main deploy-backend.yml workflow will run on push to main.
